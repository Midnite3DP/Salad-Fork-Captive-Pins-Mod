# Salad Fork Captive Pins Mod
 A Salad Fork mod for captive pins and mini pinned rama-style idlers

Captive pins as opposed to regular pins mod means your pins are shorter and are fully enclosed in the plastic. Why? I don't know. Looks cool to have completely hidden pins and there may be some other benefits.

This mod is based on the work of hartk#1213 and speedy#2640. Hartk designed the [Micron Pin Mod](https://github.com/printersforants/Micron/tree/main/Mods/Hartk/Pin_Mod/) and Speedy designed a remix of [Rama Idlers](https://github.com/Ramalama2/Voron-2-Mods/tree/main/Front_Idlers) scaled down for the Salad Fork.

My contribution was:
* Converting Hartk's Micron Pin Mod to support the Salad Fork & captive pins, as well as some geometry refinements
* Testing Speedy's initial design work and small geometry tweaks
* Some creative license on the design of the XY joints to fit the style of the AB drives more

The pin sizes are:
* x8 3x18
* x2 3x22

The 22mm pins are used for the bearing stack on the AB motors
